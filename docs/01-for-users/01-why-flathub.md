# Why Flathub?

Flatpak and Flathub allow you to easily install, run and update
applications on Linux desktop systems.

## What is Flatpak?

Flatpak is a universal package format for Linux desktop applications. It
is available on most Linux distributions. It allows you to install and
run applications in a sandboxed environment, separate from the rest of
the system. This sandboxing gives you more control over the dependencies
of your applications.

## What is Flathub?

Flathub is a centralized repository of Flatpak apps. You can use it to
install and update apps on your system.
